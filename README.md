# Project Cambridge

A simple ZX Spectrum emulator, originally built with UWP and C# before being
ported to Flutter and Dart.

Functional enough to be able to boot the supplied ZX Spectrum 48K image and
accept keyboard input, but it crashes regularly still due to (I presume) a few
remaining inaccuracies in Z80 emulation.

This is an ongoing project that I'm using to learn and improve; feel free to
contribute, critique or improve what you see. I work on this in my spare time
here and there; it's not supposed to be the pinnacle of coding accomplishment!
