# Project Cambridge

A simple ZX Spectrum emulator, originally built with UWP and C#
before being ported to Flutter and Dart. 

Functional enough to be able to boot the supplied ZX Spectrum 48K
image and accept keyboard input, but it crashes regularly still
due to (I presume) a few remaining inaccuracies in Z80 emulation. 

This is an ongoing project that I'm using to learn and improve; 
feel free to contribute, critique or improve what you see. I work
on this in my spare time here and there; it's not supposed to be
the pinnacle of coding accomplishment!

The unit tests come from FUSE, a GPL-licensed project, so I've
separated that code into a separate repo, which can be found at 
https://github.com/timsneath/cambridge-tests.
