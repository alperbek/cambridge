It only seems fitting to use `google.scr`, which is the loading screen used as
the [Google doodle][] on Google UK's homepage for St George's Day, which in 2012
coincided with the 30th anniversary of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

A little more information about the story of this Google doodle can be found on
[The Verge][] and [The Guardian][].
